# EU4AW

## ./src

Source files for the Website (Made in Svelte. God I love Svelte so much)

## ./etc

Tools I used to make the website.

## ./extracted

Files grabbed from the EU4 source that may be used for the Website, but are still unorganized.

## TODO

* Hide background behing border using a custom path in `BorderContainer.svelte`
* Make border of `BoardContainer.svelte` look nicer by adding some semi-transparent pixels to `./assets/gold_border.png`
* Make ellipses in `Button.svelte` when text is too long not overflow to the right
